This is an interdisciplinary project between statistics and nutrition undergradates, where we formulate a research question based on obesity and utilise the 2011-2 Australian Health Survey (AHS) to answer our question.

<br> __Data:__ </br>
<br> The data used is the Australian Healh Survey (AHS), a study conducte d by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and consists of 3 major parts. </br>

1. National Health Survey (2011-12)
2. National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) 2011-12
3. National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) 2011-12

<br> Participants in the NHS total approximately 20,000 whilst the NNPAS has 13,000 participants. Whilst both surveys had common questions including household information, demogrpahics, body mass, food consumption and other physical measures, the NNPAS had additional components regarding physical activity whilst NHS surveyed for medications, alcohol consumption, financial stressors etc. </br>
<br> These participants were invited to volunteer for the NHMS, which consisted of taking blood tests (12yrs+), urine tests (5yrs+) and other chronic disease markers.</br>

__IMPORTANT:__ To ensure reproducibility, ensure that the appropriate libraries are installed, and the both R, RStudio and Rmarkdown are updated to the latest version. Furthermore, the files should not be moved, as they required other files from their current relative paths.

All functions for use are stored as \<function_name\>.R

__Worklog:__

- reprocessed the raw AHS file, identifying NaN values and filtering down to the variables which are necessary. This has been stored in the output folder.
- analysis conducted for response variables including diabetes, overall cholesterol levels, HDL and LDL cholesterol as well as dyslipidemia.
